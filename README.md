A lightweight and secure command-line password manager built in Python, designed to handle user registration and authentication processes with a focus on password security. This tool uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to securely store user passwords, ensuring that sensitive information is protected. 

Key features include a straightforward user interface that guides users through account creation and login processes, with hashed passwords stored in-memory for quick and easy access. While this implementation is ideal for educational purposes or small-scale projects, it lays the groundwork for more robust security practices in larger applications.
